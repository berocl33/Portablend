provided you do not have the key for

 your apk you will need,to generate your keystore 
either fetch the ssl binary of the distro you prefer
or use the on-droid's system keystore classes(java). but my preference is generate

 the key/certificate pair and use them directly 
via apksigner. look on my bsh repository for examples.
 next make sure you have android-7 or higher compatibility.
